What is requested :

Add a “style.css” file to your project, remember, you create it by using VS Code or touch style.css, at this point, you have better knowledge on how to use git, i will start giving you less and less advice on how to make your project.
the header must be styled, i want a navigation bar that doesn’t look too bad, but here is the catch, you will have to use what you learned here, so no advanced or layout CSS to help you. i’m not gonna tell you what to do, but give you some guidelines
The navbar must have a darkish color, something that looks a bit somber, it doesn’t have to be pitch black, but here is what we are asking for.
for the font style, i want you to use montserrat or helvetica, both aren’t available so you’ll have to add them using google fonts.
for each section of your web page, i want the background color to alternate between 2 colors (you are free to choose which ones, we’ll give you some relevant links)
I want the images to have a reasonable size, something that looks good, but not too small, remember you have big screens, so go for it, change the style of your images, add some borders, add some curves to your images (border-radius)
The form, well for the form, I want each form input to take up all the available space, the button must have an orang-y color and white text.
For the footer i want you to rework it, and add some cool elements to it, surprise me, make it snappy, make it look good.
